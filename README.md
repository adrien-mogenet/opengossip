Tools for metrics analysis and fault detection. It's currently experimental only.


## Ideas
List some ideas of models to be applied:
  * Metrics that should always be evolving and never be constant (load-avg, RAM usage...)
  * Metrics that are highly related to each other (great distribution of disk usage...)
  * Metrics that should be perfectly predictable (disk usage...)

Of course, putting this or that metric into this or that model depends on your platform and 
programs that are running on it.
