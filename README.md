Tools for metrics analysis and fault detection. It's currently experimental only. Have a look at the [wiki]
(https://github.com/adrien-mogenet/opengossip/wiki) for current work's output.


## Ideas
Kind of metrics that you would want to track:
  * Metrics that should always be evolving and never be constant
  * Metrics that are highly related to each other
  * Metrics that should be perfectly predictable

Of course, putting this or that metric into this or that model depends on your platform and 
programs that are running on it.
